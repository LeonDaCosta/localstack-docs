LocalStack is a local cloud emulator that lets you build and test cloud applications entirely on your machine.

Spin up fully functional local environments that mirror real cloud behavior — including AWS services and Snowflake — without provisioning real cloud infrastructure. 

Whether you're validating IaC templates, running integration tests, or iterating on data pipelines, LocalStack integrates seamlessly with your tools and CI/CD pipelines to help you ship faster and safer.
