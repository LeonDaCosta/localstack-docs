LocalStackâ€™s Lambda Tools offer a set of utilities to streamline the local development, testing, and debugging of AWS Lambda functions. Emulating Lambda behavior on your machine lets you skip cloud deployments and iterate faster in a fully local environment.

These tools are designed to shorten feedback loops and improve the developer experience with features like:

- **IDE debugging**: Attach a debugger to your running Lambda function, set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code

- **Hot reload**: Automatically apply code changes without needing to redeploy the function, enabling rapid iteration

- **VSCode integration**: Use the LocalStack VSCode extension to deploy and invoke Lambda functions directly from your editor using SAM or CloudFormation templates.
