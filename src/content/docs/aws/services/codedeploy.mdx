## Introduction

CodeDeploy is a service that automates application deployments.
On AWS, it supports deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS services.
Furthermore, based on the target it is also possible to use an in-place deployment or a blue/green deployment.

LocalStack supports a mocking of CodeDeploy API operations.
The supported operations are listed on the [API Coverage section](#api-coverage).

## Getting Started

This guide will walk through the process of creating CodeDeploy applications, deployment configuration, deployment groups, and deployments.

Basic knowledge of the AWS CLI and the [`awslocal`](https://github.com/localstack/awscli-local) wrapper is expected.

Start LocalStack using your preferred method.

### Applications

An application is a CodeDeploy construct that uniquely identifies your targetted application.
Create an application with the [CreateApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateApplication.html) operation:

```bash
awslocal deploy create-application --application-name hello --compute-platform Server
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "applicationId": "063714b6-f438-4b90-bacb-ce04af7f5e83"
}
```

Make note of the application name, which can be used with other operations such as [GetApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_GetApplication.html), [UpdateApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateApplication.html) and [DeleteApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteApplication.html).

```bash
awslocal deploy get-application --application-name hello
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "application": {
        "applicationId": "063714b6-f438-4b90-bacb-ce04af7f5e83",
        "applicationName": "hello",
        "createTime": 1747663397.271634,
        "computePlatform": "Server"
    }
}
```

You can list all application using [ListApplications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_ListApplications.html).

```bash
awslocal deploy list-applications
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "applications": [
        "hello"
    ]
}
```

### Deployment configuration

A deployment configuration consists of rules for deployment along with success and failure criteria.

Create a deployment configuration using [CreateDeploymentConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeploymentConfig.html):

```bash
awslocal deploy create-deployment-config --deployment-config-name hello-conf \
    --compute-platform Server  \
    --minimum-healthy-hosts '{"type": "HOST_COUNT", "value": 1}'
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "deploymentConfigId": "0327ce0a-4637-4884-8899-49af7b9423b6"
}
```

[ListDeploymentConfigs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_ListDeploymentConfigs.html) can be used to list all available configs:

```bash
awslocal deploy list-deployment-configs
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "deploymentConfigsList": [
        "hello-conf"
    ]
}
```

Use [GetDeploymentConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_GetDeploymentConfig.html) and [DeleteDeploymentConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDeploymentConfig.html) to manage deployment configurations.

```bash
awslocal deploy get-deployment-config --deployment-config-name hello-conf
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "deploymentConfigInfo": {
        "deploymentConfigId": "0327ce0a-4637-4884-8899-49af7b9423b6",
        "deploymentConfigName": "hello-conf",
        "minimumHealthyHosts": {
            "type": "HOST_COUNT",
            "value": 1
        },
        "createTime": 1747663716.208291,
        "computePlatform": "Server"
    }
}
```

### Deployment groups

Deployment groups can be managed with:

- [CreateDeploymentGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeploymentGroup.html)
- [ListDeploymentGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_ListDeploymentGroups.html)
- [UpdateDeploymentGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDeploymentGroup.html)
- [GetDeploymentGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_GetDeploymentGroup.html)
- [DeleteDeploymentGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDeploymentGroup.html)

Create a deployment group with [CreateDeploymentGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeploymentGroup.html):

```bash
awslocal deploy create-deployment-group \
    --application-name hello \
    --service-role-arn arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/role \
    --deployment-group-name hello-group
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "deploymentGroupId": "09506586-9ba9-4005-a1be-840407abb39d"
}
```

List all deployment groups for an application with [ListDeploymentGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_ListDeploymentGroups.html):

```bash
awslocal deploy list-deployment-groups --application-name hello
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "deploymentGroups": [
        "hello-group"
    ]
}
```

Get a deployment group with [GetDeploymentGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_GetDeploymentGroup.html):

```bash
awslocal deploy get-deployment-group --application-name hello \
    --deployment-group-name hello-group
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "deploymentGroupInfo": {
        "applicationName": "hello",
        "deploymentGroupId": "09506586-9ba9-4005-a1be-840407abb39d",
        "deploymentGroupName": "hello-group",
        "deploymentConfigName": "CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime",
        "autoScalingGroups": [],
        "serviceRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/role",
        "triggerConfigurations": [],
        "deploymentStyle": {
            "deploymentType": "IN_PLACE",
            "deploymentOption": "WITHOUT_TRAFFIC_CONTROL"
        },
        "outdatedInstancesStrategy": "UPDATE",
        "computePlatform": "Server",
        "terminationHookEnabled": false
    }
}
```

### Deployments

Operations related to deployment management are:

- [CreateDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeployment.html)
- [GetDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_GetDeployment.html)
- [ListDeployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_ListDeployments.html)

```bash
awslocal deploy create-deployment \
    --application-name hello \
    --deployment-group-name hello-group \
    --revision '{"revisionType": "S3", "s3Location": {"bucket": "placeholder", "key": "placeholder", "bundleType": "tar"}}'
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "deploymentId": "d-TU3TNCSTO"
}
```

List all deployments for an application with [ListDeployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_ListDeployments.html):

```bash
awslocal deploy list-deployments
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "deployments": [
        "d-TU3TNCSTO"
    ]
}
```

Get a deployment with [GetDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_GetDeployment.html):
