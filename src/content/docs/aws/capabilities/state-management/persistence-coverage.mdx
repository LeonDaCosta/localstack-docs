## Persistence Coverage Overview

<PersistenceCoverage client:load />

### Terminology

- **Persistence Test Suite**: tested by LocalStack's internal persistence test suite.
To test persistence, we use an approach similar to snapshot parity test:
we first record API responses from LocalStack, we then reset and restore the snapshotted state,
and finally verify that the same API responses matches with the initial ones.
