Chaos engineering in LocalStack helps you build more resilient systems by deliberately introducing controlled disruptions into your cloud environment. Simulating failures early in the development process helps teams proactively uncover weaknesses, improve error handling, and validate system behavior under stress.

Different teams benefit from chaos engineering in different ways:

- Software Developers test application logic and error response behavior
- Architects evaluate the robustness of system design
- Operations teams investigate infrastructure reliability under adverse conditions

LocalStack supports the following chaos engineering features:

- **Application behavior and error management**: AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS) simulates errors and latency
- **Robust architecture**: Failover testing and resilience validation via the Chaos API
- **Consistent infrastructure setup**: Disruption-tolerant provisioning to verify consistent infrastructure under unstable conditions

The best way to get started is by practicing running experiments yourself. Check out our [chaos engineering tutorials](/aws/tutorials).
