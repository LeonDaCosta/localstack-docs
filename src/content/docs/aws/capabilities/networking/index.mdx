## Troubleshooting

If you have difficulties connecting your application code to LocalStack, please choose the scenario below that best describes your networking layout.

:::tip
LocalStack only binds to IPv4 addresses (e.g. `127.0.0.1`). Check you are not trying to access LocalStack over IPv6.
:::

## [Using the endpoint URL](/aws/capabilities/networking/accessing-endpoint-url)

For example, setting the `endpoint_url` parameter with an [AWS SDK](/aws/integrations/aws-sdks/).

<CardGridLayout cards={[
  {
    title: "From the same computer",
    href: "/aws/capabilities/networking/accessing-endpoint-url#from-the-same-computer",
    imageSrc: "/images/aws/1.svg",
    imageWidth: 400
  },
  {
    title: "From a container LocalStack created",
    href: "/aws/capabilities/networking/accessing-endpoint-url#from-a-container-localstack-created",
    imageSrc: "/images/aws/4.svg",
    imageWidth: 400
  },
  {
    title: "From your container",
    href: "/aws/capabilities/networking/accessing-endpoint-url#from-your-container",
    imageSrc: "/images/aws/7.svg",
    imageWidth: 400
  },
  {
    title: "From a separate host",
    href: "/aws/capabilities/networking/accessing-endpoint-url#from-a-separate-host",
    imageSrc: "/images/aws/10.svg",
    imageWidth: 400
  }
]} />

## [Using transparent endpoint injection](/aws/capabilities/networking/transparent-endpoint-injection)

For example, you have a Lambda function that needs to access LocalStack resources.

<CardGridLayout cards={[
  {
    title: "From your host",
    href: "/aws/capabilities/networking/transparent-endpoint-injection#from-your-host",
    imageSrc: "/images/aws/2.svg",
    imageWidth: 400
  },
  {
    title: "From a lambda function",
    href: "/aws/capabilities/networking/transparent-endpoint-injection#from-a-lambda-function",
    imageSrc: "/images/aws/5.svg",
    imageWidth: 400
  }
]} />

## [Accessing a resource created by LocalStack](/aws/capabilities/networking/accessing-resources-created)

For example, you have created an OpenSearch cluster and are trying to access that resource by its URL.

<CardGridLayout cards={[
  {
    title: "From your host",
    href: "/aws/capabilities/networking/accessing-resources-created#from-your-host",
    imageSrc: "/images/aws/3.svg",
    imageWidth: 300
  },
  {
    title: "From a container LocalStack created",
    href: "/aws/capabilities/networking/accessing-resources-created#from-a-container-localstack-created",
    imageSrc: "/images/aws/6.svg",
    imageWidth: 300
  },
  {
    title: "From your container",
    href: "/aws/capabilities/networking/accessing-resources-created#from-your-container",
    imageSrc: "/images/aws/9.svg",
    imageWidth: 300
  },
  {
    title: "From a separate host",
    href: "/aws/capabilities/networking/accessing-resources-created#from-a-separate-host",
    imageSrc: "/images/aws/12.svg",
    imageWidth: 300
  }
]} />
