## Introduction

LocalStack Cloud Sandbox lets you deploy a fully functional LocalStack instance in the cloud instead of running it locally. This enables new workflows for testing, previewing, and collaboration across teams.

Key use cases include:

- Running ephemeral instances locally for dev/test loops in CI
- Generating on-demand preview environments by enabling preview-per-PR type workflows
- Facilitate collaboration by sharing a consistent testing environment for all developers

:::note
The Cloud Sandbox feature is currently in **preview** and under active development.
