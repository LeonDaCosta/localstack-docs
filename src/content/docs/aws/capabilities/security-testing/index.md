Security Testing in LocalStack allows you to enforce and validate IAM policies in a local environment that closely mirrors real AWS behavior. This helps you catch misconfigurations, uncover missing permissions, and confidently test access control logic.

LocalStack supports the following security testing features:

- Enforce IAM policies to simulate realistic permission boundaries in your application
- Retrieve Policy engine logs for debugging and understanding how policies are evaluated
- Apply IAM policy streams to discover required permissions and resolve access issues efficiently
