LocalStack supports messaging and event-driven architectures by integrating with services like Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka). This section explains how to connect LocalStack with a self-managed Kafka cluster for local development and testing of stream-based applications.

Use this setup to simulate production-like messaging flows, without relying on managed cloud infrastructure.
