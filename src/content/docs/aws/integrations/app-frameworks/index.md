LocalStack supports popular application frameworks that simplify building and deploying serverless and event-driven applications. With these integrations, you can develop locally using the same tools and abstractions you rely on in production, while also benefiting from faster feedback loops and no cloud dependencies.

This section covers how to use LocalStack with:

- Serverless Framework
- Architect (ARC)
- Quarkus
- Spring Cloud Function

Each guide shows how to configure the framework to work seamlessly with LocalStack for local development and testing.
