LocalStack integrates with popular testing frameworks and platforms to help you automate and scale cloud application testing. LocalStack makes it easier to run containers with isolated test environments or execute parallel tests in CI pipelines.

This section covers how to use LocalStack with:

- **Testcontainers**: spin up reproducible, containerized test environments
- **LambdaTest HyperExecute**: fast, scalable execution of cloud-native test suites
