LocalStack supports a wide range of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, enabling you to provision and test cloud resources locally using the same declarative workflows you'd use with AWS. This helps teams validate templates, debug deployments, and iterate faster without touching a real AWS account.

This section covers how to use LocalStack with:

- Terraform
- Pulumi
- Crossplane
- Cloud Custodian
- Former2

With LocalStack, you can validate infrastructure changes locally and catch issues early, before hitting the real cloud.
