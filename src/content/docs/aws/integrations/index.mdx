LocalStack supports a wide range of integrations from the cloud development ecosystem. These integrations make it easy to run your existing AWS workflows locally, without modifying your tooling.

## The Cloud Development Ecosystem

Cloud development spans a broad set of tools and practices. Whether youâ€™re provisioning Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) with tools like Terraform or CloudFormation, or building applications with AWS SDKs like `boto3` or `aws-sdk-js`, LocalStack helps you bring the entire workflow to your local machine. Get ready to speed up your feedback loops and reduce your cloud dependencies.

## Integrations

We strive to make the integration of LocalStack into your workflow as seamless as possible. 
Sometimes it's as easy as calling one of our wrapper tools, like `awslocal`, a drop-in replacement for the `aws` CLI. Other times, there's a bit of configuration involved.

Here is a list of tool integrations we support, and documentation on how to integrate LocalStack.
